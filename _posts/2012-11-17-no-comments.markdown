intro: "I switched comments off recently for one simple reason : i don't
think they add any value to the blog posts, I don't really care about
being read, i just write those when I have gone through a tough install
process, in order to help. That's all.<br/><br/>Am I being antisocial ?
on the contrary, i'd love an in depth involved chat on quite any
subject, but not through bloody comments is all."

#No comments

##Why ?

Cause i'm not really interested anymore. If you wish to correct
something on a blog post here, if you really care cause i've written
something nonsensical or plainly false, please contact me via twitter or
at the following address (take out the 'x') pxextxexrx dxoxt
cxaxtxhxbxaxd dxoxt hxoxsxt axt gxmxaxixlx

##But comments are good !

Personnal experience ?

Really, I don't think so. It's been 17 years since i first dipped my
feet into usenet, and i've never really gotten anything useful out of a
"passing by" comment. So i'm taking the decision to not care anymore and
shut them down.

You can contact me by mail, I do answer mail, and i like to discuss
things in depth.
